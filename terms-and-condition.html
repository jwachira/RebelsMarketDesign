                    By using the Site in any manner, including but not limited to visiting or browsing the Site, you (the "user" or "you") agree to be bound by this Agreement, including those additional terms and conditions and policies referenced herein and/or available by hyperlink. This Agreement applies to all users of the Site, including without limitation users who are vendors, customers, merchants, contributors of content, information and other materials or services on the Site. <br> <br>

                  <h2>1. Rebelsmarket is a Venue</h2>
                  <p>
                    Rebelsmarket acts as a venue to allow users who comply with Rebelsmarket's policies to offer, sell and buy certain fashion items  within a fixed-price format. Rebelsmarket is not directly involved in the transaction between buyers and sellers. As a result, Rebelsmarket has no control over the quality, safety, morality or legality of any aspect of the items listed, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to pay for items. Rebelsmarket does not pre-screen users or the content or information provided by users. Rebelsmarket cannot ensure that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction.
Consequently, Rebelsmarket does not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer.
Rebelsmarket cannot guarantee the true identity, age, and nationality of a user. Rebelsmarket encourages you to communicate directly with potential transaction partners through the tools available on the Site. You may also wish to consider using a third-party escrow service or services that provide additional user verification.
You agree that Rebelsmarket is a venue and as such is not responsible or liable for any content, for example, data, text, information, usernames, graphics, images, photographs, profiles, audio, video, items, and links posted by you, other users, or outside parties on Rebelsmarket. You use the Rebelsmarket service at your own risk.
                  </p>

                  <h2>3. Fees and Services</h2>
                  <p>
                    Joining and setting up a shop on Rebelsmarket is free. Rebelsmarket charges fees for listing an item for sale, as well as a percentage of the sale price when the item sells. When you list an item you have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. Rebelsmarket's Listing Fees Policy , which is subject to change, is incorporated into this Agreement by reference. Changes to the Fees Policy and the fees for Rebelsmarket's services are effective after Rebelsmarket provides you with at least fourteen (14) days' notice by posting the changes on the Site. However, Rebelsmarket may choose to temporarily change the Listing Fees Policy and the fees for Rebelsmarket's services for promotional events (for example, free listing days); such changes are effective when Rebelsmarket posts the temporary promotional event on the Site. Rebelsmarket may, at Rebelsmarket's sole discretion, change some or all of Rebelsmarket's services at any time. In the event Rebelsmarket introduces a new service, the fees for that service are effective at the launch of the service. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in US Dollars (USD).
You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with using Rebelsmarket. Rebelsmarket keeps accepted payment information on file. At the beginning of the month, each seller is emailed an invoice detailing the amount due. A seller must pay the amount due in full within 15 days of the date of the invoice.
Fees and Termination: If Rebelsmarket terminates a listing or your account, if you close your account, or if the payment of your Rebelsmarket fees cannot be completed for any reason, you remain obligated to pay Rebelsmarket for all unpaid fees plus any penalties, if applicable. If the seller's account is not paid in full and becomes past due, the seller risks penalties such as the suspension of privileges and/or termination of the account and other collection mechanisms (including retaining collection agencies and legal counsel). If you have a question or wish to dispute a charge,  <a href="mailto:legalservices@RebelsMarket.com">legalservices@RebelsMarket.com</a>
                  </p>
                  <h2>4. Listing and Selling</h2>
                  <p>
                    Listing Description: By listing an item on the Site you warrant that you and all aspects of the item comply with Rebelsmarket's published policies. You also warrant that you may legally sell the item. You must accurately describe your item and all terms of sale in your Rebelsmarket shop. Your listings may only include text descriptions, graphics, pictures and other content relevant to the sale of that item. All items must be listed in an appropriate category with appropriate tags. Each listing must accurately and completely describe the item/items for sale in that listing. If the "in stock" quantity is more than one, all items in that listing must be identical. Each unique item must have its own listing.
Shop Policies: All sellers are urged to outline shop policies for their Rebelsmarket shop. These policies may include, for example, shipping, returns, payment and selling policies. Sellers must create reasonable policies in good faith and must abide by such policies. All shop policies must comply with Rebelsmarket's site-wide policies. Sellers are responsible for enforcing their own reasonable shop policies. Rebelsmarket reserves the right to request that a seller modify a shop policy.
Binding Sale: All sales are binding. The seller is obligated to ship the order or otherwise complete the transaction with the buyer in a prompt manner, unless there is an exceptional circumstance, such as: (a) the buyer fails to meet the terms of the seller's listing (such as payment method), or (b) the seller cannot authenticate the buyer's identity. The buyer is obligated to deliver appropriate payment for items purchased, unless there is an exceptional circumstance.
Fee Avoidance: The price stated in each item listing description must be an accurate representation of the sale. Sellers may charge reasonable shipping and handling fees to cover the costs for packaging and mailing the items. Sellers may not charge excessive shipping fees or otherwise avoid fees. You may not alter the item's price after a sale for the purpose of avoiding Rebelsmarket transaction fees, misrepresent the item's location, or use another user's account without permission.

                    Furthermore, you may not list any item on Rebelsmarket (or consummate any transaction that was initiated using Rebelsmarket's service) that, by paying to Rebelsmarket the listing fee or the final value fee, could cause Rebelsmarket to violate any applicable law, statute, ordinance or regulation, or that violates the Terms of Use.
